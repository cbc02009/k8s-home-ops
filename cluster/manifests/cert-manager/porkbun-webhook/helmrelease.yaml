    # The GroupName here is used to identify your company or business unit that
    # created this webhook.
    # For example, this may be "acme.mycompany.com".
    # This name will need to be referenced in each Issuer's `webhook` stanza to
    # inform cert-manager of where to send ChallengePayload resources in order to
    # solve the DNS01 challenge.
    # This group name should be **unique**, hence using your own company's domain
    # here is recommended.

    # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
